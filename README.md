# Health-care-chatbot-assistant Project


Overview
The Healthcare Assistant Chatbot is an interactive web application built using Python, Streamlit, and Hugging Face Transformers. It is designed to assist users with basic healthcare-related queries, provide general guidance, and offer a conversational experience. The chatbot combines rule-based logic for common healthcare topics with an AI-powered text generation model for open-ended questions, ensuring both relevance and adaptability in its responses.

Detailed Description
Technology Stack:

Python: Core programming language for backend logic.

Streamlit: Used to create a simple and interactive web interface.

Hugging Face Transformers (distilgpt2): Provides AI-generated responses for user queries.

NLTK: Utilized for basic natural language processing tasks, such as tokenization and stopword removal.

Features:

User-Friendly Interface: Users interact with the chatbot through a Streamlit web app, entering queries and receiving instant responses.

Healthcare-Specific Logic: For common healthcare terms like "symptom," "appointment," or "medication," the chatbot provides predefined, reliable advice and suggestions.

AI-Generated Responses: For more general or complex queries, the chatbot leverages the distilgpt2 language model to generate natural, context-aware replies.

Real-Time Processing: The application processes input and displays responses in real time, enhancing user engagement.

Extensible Design: The rule-based logic can be expanded to cover more healthcare topics, and the underlying model can be upgraded for improved performance.

How It Works:

The user enters a query into the Streamlit interface.

The chatbot checks for healthcare-specific keywords and returns a predefined response if a match is found.

If no keyword is matched, the query is passed to the Hugging Face model, which generates a relevant response.

The response is displayed to the user in the web app.

Intended Use:

This chatbot is intended for basic informational and guidance purposes only. It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.s
